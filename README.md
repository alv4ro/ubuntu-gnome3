# Ubuntu GNOME3

These are [live-build](http://live.debian.net/manual/de/html/live-manual.html)  configuration files that will produce as output an Ubuntu-based gnome3 fresh and clean distribution. It has no applications but the minimal ones to provide a complete hardware and desktop configuration support.

My idea is to save you the big task of selecting a stable base of packages which, of course, you could take from ubuntu-desktop (task and metapackage), but it would inherit every Ubuntu branding and config.
I have selected just a little base of packages with no libraries mess (as ubuntu-desktop has), just Xorg, gnome and not much more.

You can find more info about how to build an ISO and how to customize the basics (packages and repositories) in the [Wiki](https://github.com/rcmorano/ubuntu-gnome3/wiki/ISO-building). For additional info, please, refer to the [official documentation](http://live.debian.net/manual/de/html/live-manual.html) or manpages.
